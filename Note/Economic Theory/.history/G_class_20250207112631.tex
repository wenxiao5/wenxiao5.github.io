\section{Hyperbolic Discounting}
The classical discounting model discounts as $1,\delta,\delta^2,...$, i.e., $f(t)=\delta^t$ which discounts at a constant rate. However, the hyperbolic discounting model discounts faster in short run and slower in long run (i.e., we care more about now than future, and the difference of two future dates is small.)
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        u_\textnormal{day1}\succ u_\textnormal{day2}\succ \cdots u_\textnormal{day365}\sim u_\textnormal{day366}
    \end{aligned}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
The functional form can be given by
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        f(t)=\left(1+\alpha t\right)^{-\frac{\gamma}{\alpha}}
    \end{aligned}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
The discount rate is declining with time, $-\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)}=\frac{\gamma}{1+\alpha t}$.

\paragraph*{Quasi Hyperbolic Discounting}
A good approximation of the hyperbolic discounting model is
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        U_t=u_t+\beta\left[\delta u_{t+1}+\delta^2 u_{t+2}+\cdots+\right]
    \end{aligned}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ is the uniformly discount rate for future utility.

\paragraph*{Dynamic Inconsistency} Preference hold at $t$ do not agree with preference hold at $t+1$.


\paragraph*{Application to Procrastination}
Cost Minimization Model:

Each period $t$ is consisted of three parts, 1. Pay cost $L$ because task is not done, 2. Observe current cost to do the task, $c\sim \textnormal{Unif}[0,1]$, 3. Choose to do task in $t$ or not.

Agent's decision follows a quasi hyperbolic discounting model, where we have $\beta<1$ and $\delta=1$. Agent has a sophisticated belief about her future behavior if $\hat{\beta}=\beta$ and has a naive belief about her future behavior if $\hat{\beta}>\beta$.

The optimal strategy is given by a critical cost $c^*$ such that the agent do the task if and only if $c\leq c^*$. Then, the expected undiscounted cost $v$ follows
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        v=L+c^*\underbrace{\frac{c^*}{2}}_\textnormal{average cost conditional on $c\leq c^*$}+(1-c^*)v
    \end{aligned}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
The agent should be indifferent between doing the task and delaying:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        c^*=\beta v
    \end{aligned}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
which gives us
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        c^*=\sqrt{\frac{L}{1/\beta-1/2}}
    \end{aligned}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}
