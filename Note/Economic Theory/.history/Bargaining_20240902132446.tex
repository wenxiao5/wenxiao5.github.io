\chapter{\cite{fuchs2022dynamic}: Dynamic Bargaining with Private Information}

\section{``Classic'' Coase Conjecture}
Consider a seller facing a buyer has private value of the good $v\in[1,2]$ that is distributed according to an atomless distribution with full support, $F(v)$. The seller has cost $c\geq 0$ to serve the buyer. Every period of an infinite horizon game, the uninformed seller makes an offer $p_t$. If $p_t$ is accepted, the game ends with payoffs $v-p_t$ and $p_t-c$ for the buyer and the seller, respectively. If $p_t$ is rejected, the seller makes another offer at time $t+\Delta$. Both buyer and seller discount future with the rate $r$. Thus, $\Delta$ can be thought of as the commitment power of the seller.

Since higher-value buyers lose more from delay, the Skimming Property holds in any equilibrium.
\begin{lemma}[Skimming Property]
    If type $v$ is willing to accept an offer $p_t$, then all higher types strictly prefer to accept this offer.
\end{lemma}
Denote by $k_t$ the highest type remaining before the offer at time $t$ is made. Then, the seller beliefs at time $t$ are $v\in[1,k_t]$ with truncated distribution $F(v)/F(k_t)$, where $k_0=2$.


A distinction arises in this game: (1). $c<1$ (the gap case); (2). $c=1$ (the no-gap case).
