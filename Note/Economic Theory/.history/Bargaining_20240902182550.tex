\chapter{\cite{fuchs2022dynamic}: Dynamic Bargaining with Private Information}

\section{``Classic'' Coase Conjecture}
Consider a seller facing a buyer has private value of the good $v\in[1,2]$ that is distributed according to an atomless distribution with full support, $F(v)$. The seller has cost $c\geq 0$ to serve the buyer. Every period of an infinite horizon game, the uninformed seller makes an offer $p_t$. If $p_t$ is accepted, the game ends with payoffs $v-p_t$ and $p_t-c$ for the buyer and the seller, respectively. If $p_t$ is rejected, the seller makes another offer at time $t+\Delta$. Both buyer and seller discount future with the rate $r$. Thus, $\Delta$ can be thought of as the commitment power of the seller.

Since higher-value buyers lose more from delay, the Skimming Property holds in any equilibrium.
\begin{lemma}[Skimming Property]
    If type $v$ is willing to accept an offer $p_t$, then all higher types strictly prefer to accept this offer.
\end{lemma}
Denote by $k_t$ the highest type remaining before the offer at time $t$ is made. Then, the seller beliefs at time $t$ are $v\in[1,k_t]$ with truncated distribution $F(v)/F(k_t)$, where $k_0=2$.


A distinction arises in this game: (1). $c<1$ (the gap case); (2). $c=1$ (the no-gap case).

As shown by \cite{fudenberg1985infinite} and \cite{gul1986foundations}, the game must end in a finite number of rounds (uniformly bounded for all $\Delta$). The intuition is: the difference between distinguishing $k_t$ and an immediate trading $1$ is $k_t-1$. If the $k_t-1$ is relative small to $1-c$. The seller prefers an immediate trade rather than keep bargaining. So, there is a critical $k_t$ that is close enough to $1$ and the seller offers $p_t=1$ to get an immediate trade.

By the backward induction, equilibrium must be unique (up to seller's randomization at time $0$). These equilibria have the property that the seller value depends only on the state of the game, $k_t$, a property called ``stationarity'' that is similar to the equilibria being Markov.

Stationary equilibria continue to exist when $c = 1$, but other nonstationary equilibrium can be constructed by \cite{ausubel1989reputation}.

Formally, the Coase conjecture (\cite{coase1972durability}) states that
\begin{proposition}[Coase Conjecture]
    As $\Delta \rightarrow 0$ (i.e., the seller loses all ability to commit to prices), prices fall to the lowest buyer valuation, $p_0 \rightarrow 1$, and there is no inefficient delay.
\end{proposition}


\section{Exogenously Interdependent Values}
Suppose the cost of selling to type $v$ is an increasing function of the buyer's type $c(v)$ with $c'(v)$. We assume that immediate trade is strictly efficient for all $v\in (1,2]$, $c(v)<v$.

The equilibrium dynamics depend on the degree of adverse selection.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If there is little adverse selection, i.e., $\mathbb{E}[c(v)]\leq 1$, the continuous-time limit of the unique stationary equilibrium has immediate trade (\cite{deneckere2006bargaining}).
    \item If there is more adverse selection, $\mathbb{E}[c(v)]>1$, the seller would prefer not to trade at all rather than offering $p_0=1$ and trading with all types, so trade cannot be efficient in equilibrium.\\
    No trade cannot be an equilibrium either:
    \subitem For no trade to be an equilibrium, prices would always have to be above $2$. If the price were ever lower, a mass of buyers $(2-\epsilon,2]$ would accept this price, contradicting to no trade.
    \subitem If the price were always above $2$, there would be a profitable deviation for the seller. The seller could offer $p_0 = c(2) < 2$ and then
    offer a sequence of prices that would lead to no losses.
\end{enumerate}
What then do equilibria look like?
