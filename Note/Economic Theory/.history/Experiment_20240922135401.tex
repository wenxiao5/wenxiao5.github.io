\chapter{Becker-DeGroot-Marschak Mechanism}
\cite{karni1987preference} showed that the BDM is not incentive compatible when the object being valued is a lottery. The BDM can elicit the certainty equivalents of given lotteries if and only if the respondent's preferences can be represented by expected utility functional.


\chapter{Choice in Context}
\section{\cite{simonson1989choice}: Choice Based on Reasons: The Case of Attraction and Compromise Effects}
Two effects about consumers' choices are introduced:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Attraction Effect} (asymmetric dominance effect): When an asymmetrically dominated or relatively inferior alternative is added to a set, the attractiveness and choice probability of the dominating alternative increase.
    \item \textbf{Compromise Effect}: An alternative would tend to gain market share when it becomes a compromise or middle option in the set.
\end{enumerate}
This paper use the framework that decision makers make the choice that is supported by the best overall reasons to analyze these attraction and compromise effects.

It’s good that this paper aims to explain both the attraction and compromise effects through a single framework. However, the mechanism and explanation the paper proposes for these two effects is not fully validated by the experiments.

Decision-makers take into account others’ evaluations and make choices based on their expectations of the evaluators’ preferences. One reason for choosing middle alternatives may be the uncertainty surrounding these preferences. But what if the evaluators’ preferences are clearly defined and extreme? I would propose an experiment where participants are told their decisions will be evaluated by evaluators with a common, extreme preference. According to the theory presented in the paper, participants would then be more likely to choose an extreme alternative that aligns with the evaluators’ preferences, rather than opting for a middle option. This could help further test and refine the proposed mechanism and explanation.


\section{\cite{simonson1992choice}: Choice in Context: Tradeoff Contrast and Extremeness Aversion}
This paper takes a context-based approach to explain tradeoff contrast and extremeness aversion, which also offers a new mechanism for understanding the attraction and compromise effects described in earlier work. By framing decision-making through the lens of reference dependence and loss aversion, it provides a powerful alternative to the traditional value maximization framework in classical economic theory, where such psychological influences are often overlooked.

This perspective is especially useful for firms in designing product lines and attributes, as it highlights how the context in which products are presented can significantly influence consumer preferences. However, while the theory is compelling, it would be even more impactful if we could quantify these context effects and the degree of loss aversion. Such quantification could broaden the practical applications.

In the future (or perhaps this is already done), it would be beneficial to develop formal models that integrate this framework into economic theory, enabling its use in quantitative analysis. A formalization of context effects and loss aversion within an economic model would bridge the gap between behavioral insights and actionable, data-driven decision-making.

\section{\cite{evangelidis2018asymmetric}: The Asymmetric Impact of Context on Advantaged Versus Disadvantaged Options}
To explain this, the authors propose a hierarchical decision-making framework:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Firstly, decision makers examine whether one of the alternatives dominates all the others in the set. If there is no such alternative,
    \item decision makers then search for the next easiest solution - an option that allows them to avoid considering the subjective value of an attribute and making detailed analyses of trade-offs. If they still cannot find such an option,
    \item they determine which of the two attributes is most important to them and select the option that scores the highest on that attribute.
\end{enumerate}


This paper examines the asymmetric impact of context effects, specifically showing that such effects are more likely to occur when a new option similar to the disadvantaged alternative (the weaker or lower-share option) is introduced into a binary choice set. This finding builds on previous literature, offering a fresh perspective on how context influences decision-making, particularly in relation to asymmetric dominance and extremeness aversion.

One of the key contributions of this paper is the proposal of a hierarchical decision-making process, which highlights the complexity behind consumer choices. Unlike prior research that tends to assume a simpler decision-making process of trade-offs, this approach emphasizes that individuals may use different strategies depending on the choice set. By recognizing this, the paper suggests that incorporating hierarchical models of decision-making or information acquisition provide new insights for future research, both in quantitative and behavioral studies.

From a practical standpoint, the paper’s insights are valuable for firms designing product lines or attributes. However, while understanding the decision-making process is crucial, companies typically base their product designs on consumer preferences. Combining insights on consumer preferences with the decision-making process could significantly enhance the applicability of these findings in practice. Unfortunately, this paper does not explore the interaction between these two factors, leaving an important and interesting direction for future research.


\section{\cite{evangelidis2023upscaling}: The Upscaling Effect: How the Decision Context Influences Tradeoffs between Desirability and Feasibility}
This paper introduces a novel context effect, termed the upscaling effect, wherein the introduction of a symmetrically dominated decoy option increases the choice share of the high-desirability (HD) option rather than the high-feasibility (HF) option. The authors propose a two-stage decision-making process to explain this phenomenon, suggesting that consumers first identify the HD option as a promising alternative and then seek justifications to support this choice, particularly when a decoy is introduced.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Individuals first look for “the alternative that most naturally can be seen as dominant over the others.” This paper proposes that a high-desirability (i.e., HD) option is more likely to be identified as a promising alternative compared to a high-feasibility (i.e., HF) alternative.
    \item Secondly, consumers will seek to accumulate evidence that supports choice of the promising alternative.
    \subitem Generally, if consumers can identify a reason that allows them to justify choosing the HD option, they will terminate the decision process by selecting the said option. If they cannot identify strong enough reasons supporting the choice of the HD option, consumers may subsequently look for reasons supporting the choice of the HF alternative or defer choice.
\end{enumerate}

This theory builds on the choice based on reasons framework, similar to the approach used in prior research. It’s a valuable perspective for understanding decision-making processes, but I wonder whether the reference dependence and loss aversion framework from another key paper could also explain this effect. For instance, a simple explanation could be that introducing a dominated decoy lowers individuals’ reference points for both desirability and feasibility. Consequently, the loss aversion associated with the lower feasibility of the HD option diminishes, making the HD option more appealing and gaining a higher market share.

Beyond this alternative explanation, it would be interesting to examine the upscaling effect in non-binary choice sets, which could have more practical implications. Extending the study of this effect beyond binary sets may offer valuable insights into more complex real-world business applications.


\chapter{Overthinking}
\section{\cite{wilson1993introspecting}: Introspecting About Reasons Can Reduce Post-Choice Satisfaction}
This paper proposes a theory that: People assign weights to the different attributes of alternatives that produce a satisfactory choice. Introspecting about reasons can change the optimal weighting scheme of the attributes into a suboptimal one. Because people focus more on attributes that are easy to verbalize and seem like plausible reasons, when they analyze reasons. The change of weighting scheme changes people's preferences. As time goes, their initial preferences return, so they regret their choices.
