\chapter{Becker-DeGroot-Marschak Mechanism}
\cite{karni1987preference} showed that the BDM is not incentive compatible when the object being valued is a lottery. The BDM can elicit the certainty equivalents of given lotteries if and only if the respondent's preferences can be represented by expected utility functional.

\section{\cite{simonson1989choice}: Choice Based on Reasons: The Case of Attraction and Compromise Effects}
Two effects about consumers' choices are introduced:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Attraction Effect} (asymmetric dominance effect): When an asymmetrically dominated or relatively inferior alternative is added to a set, the attractiveness and choice probability of the dominating alternative increase.
    \item \textbf{Compromise Effect}: An alternative would tend to gain market share when it becomes a compromise or middle option in the set.
\end{enumerate}
This paper use the framework that decision makers make the choice that is supported by the best overall reasons to analyze these attraction and compromise effects.

It’s good that this paper aims to explain both the attraction and compromise effects through a single framework. However, the mechanism and explanation the paper proposes for these two effects is not fully validated by the experiments.

Decision-makers take into account others’ evaluations and make choices based on their expectations of the evaluators’ preferences. One reason for choosing middle alternatives may be the uncertainty surrounding these preferences. But what if the evaluators’ preferences are clearly defined and extreme? I would propose an experiment where participants are told their decisions will be evaluated by evaluators with a common, extreme preference. According to the theory presented in the paper, participants would then be more likely to choose an extreme alternative that aligns with the evaluators’ preferences, rather than opting for a middle option. This could help further test and refine the proposed mechanism and explanation.
