There is a redesign of eBay:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Before the redesign: ranking according to a relevance algorithm.
    \item After the redesign: first prompting consumers to identify an exact product, then comparing seller listings of that product  head-to-head, ranked (mostly) by price.
\end{itemize}
