There is a redesign of eBay:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Before the redesign: ranking according to a relevance algorithm.
    \item After the redesign: first prompting consumers to identify an exact product, then comparing seller listings of that product  head-to-head, ranked (mostly) by price.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conceptual Framework}
Trade-off between guiding consumers to their most desired products and strengthening seller  incentives to provide better product attributes.

There are $J$ sellers. Each product $j$ has a fixed vector of attributes $x_j$ and a posted price $p_j$ (determined by the seller). Each consumer $i$ arrives at the platform is defined by a vector of characteristics $\xi_i$.
