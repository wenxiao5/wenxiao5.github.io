\section{Problem}
The problem of estimating supply-and-demand models in markets with product differentiation.


\section{What's New?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Discrete-choice model.
    \item Unobserved demand factors are considered.
    \item Estimation by "inverting" the market-share equation to find the implied mean levels of utility for each good.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{note}
    \textbf{The problem of previous empirical model:} a system of $N$ goods gives $N^2$ elasticizes to estimate.
\end{note}
This paper put some structure based by making assumptions on consumer utility. It uses the aggregation of consumers' individual choice to estimate demand.

\section{Model}
\textbf{Data:} The econometrician is assumed to observe the market outcomes of price and quantities sold by each firm.
\subsection{Settings}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item There are $R$ independent markets.
    \item There are $N_r$ firms in market $r$, with each firm producing one product. (For simplicity, we omit $r$ in following notations).
    \item For product $j$, the observed characteristics are denoted by $z_{j}=(x_j,w_j)\in \mathbb{R}^k$.\\ Specifically, $z_j$ includes two parts:
    \subitem characteristics that affect demand $x_j$;
    \subitem characteristics that affect marginal cost $w_j$.
    \item For product $j$, the unobserved characteristics are denoted by $(\xi_j,\omega_j)\in \mathbb{R}^k$.\\ Specifically, $(\xi_j,\omega_j)$ includes two parts:
    \subitem unobserved characteristics that affect demand $\xi_j$;
    \subitem unobserved characteristics that affect marginal cost $\omega_j$.\\
    Unobserved characteristics are mean independent of observed characteristics and independent across markets.
    \item Price of product $j$ is denoted by $p_j$.
    \item \textbf{Discrete Choice Model:} the utility of consumer $i$ for product $j$: $$u_{ij}=U(x_j,\xi_j,p_j,v_i,\theta_d)$$
    \subitem $v_i$ captures the consumer $i$'s consumer-specific terms that are not observed by the econometrician;
    \subitem $\theta_d$ are demand parameters.\\
    Consider a simple random coefficients specification for utility,
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            u_{ij}&=U(x_j,\xi_j,p_j,v_i=\tilde{\beta}_i,\theta_d=\alpha)\\
            &=x_j\tilde{\beta}_i-\alpha p_j+\xi_j+\epsilon_{ij}
        \end{aligned}
        \tag{(2)}
        \label{(2)}
    \end{equation}
    where $\epsilon_{ij}$ represents the distribution of consumer preferences about this mean, and $\alpha$ is invariant across consumers (although not necessary).
    \subitem Decompose consumer $i$'s taste parameter for characteristic $k$ as
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            \tilde{\beta}_{ik}=\beta_k+\sigma_k\xi_{ik}
        \end{aligned}
        \tag{(3)}
        \label{(3)}
    \end{equation}
    where $\beta_k$ is the mean level of taste for characteristic $k$ and $\xi_{ik}\sim N(0,1)$.\\
    Combing \ref{(2)} and \ref{(3)}, we can write
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            u_{ij}=\sum_{k}x_{jk}\tilde{\beta}_{ik}
        \end{aligned}
        \nonumber
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
