\section{\cite{dinerstein2018consumer}: Consumer Price Search and Platform Design in Internet Commerce}
There is a redesign of eBay:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Before the redesign: ranking according to a relevance algorithm.
    \item After the redesign: first prompting consumers to identify an exact product, then comparing seller listings of that product  head-to-head, ranked (mostly) by price.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conceptual Framework}
Trade-off between guiding consumers to their most desired products and strengthening seller  incentives to provide better product attributes.
