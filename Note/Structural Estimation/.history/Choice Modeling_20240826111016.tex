\section{Random Utility Models}
Let $j=1,...,J_i$ index the ``inside goods'' available to consumer $i$ while $j=0$ denotes the outside good. A consumer's choice set is characterized by $J_i$ and a set $\chi_i$, which may include
\begin{enumerate}[$\circ$]
    \item observed characteristics of consumer $i$,
    \item observed characteristics of goods (including prices),
    \item observed characteristics of the local market,
    \item and characteristics of the market or goods that are unobserved to the researcher.
\end{enumerate}
Each consumer $i$ has a (conditional indirect) utility $u_{ij}$ for good $j$. Consumer knows her utilities for all goods and chooses the good with the highest utility. We can represent consumer $i$'s choice with the vector $(q_{i1},...,q_{iJ_i})$, where
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        q_{ij}=\mathbf{1}\{u_{ij}\geq u_{ik},\forall k\}
    \end{aligned}
    \nonumber
\end{equation}

In this model, the heterogeneity of consumer preferences is modeled by random utilities:
\begin{definition}[Random Utility Model]
    Given the choice set $(J_i, \chi_i)$, each consumer's utility vector $(u_{ij})_{j=0,1,...,J_i}$ is an independent draw from a joint distribution $F_u(\cdot\mid J_i, \chi_i)$.
\end{definition}
Since only the ordinal ranking of goods matters for a consumer's behavior, we can normalize the location and scale of each consumer's utility vector without loss of generality. We assume that ``ties'' ($u_{ij}=u_{ik}$ for some $j\neq k$) occur with probability zero in the distribution $F_u(\cdot\mid J_i, \chi_i)$.
