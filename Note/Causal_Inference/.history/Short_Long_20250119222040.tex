\chapter{Predicting Long-term Outcomes}
\section{Surrogate Index: \cite{athey2019surrogate}}
Define two samples $N_E$ (Experimental) and $N_O$ (Observational), $N=N_E+N_O$, where we use $P_i\in\{O,E\}$ as a binary indicator of whether $i$-th observation is in $N_E$ or $N_O$.

For each unit, we have
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
        \hline
            $X_i$& vector & pre-treatment covariates for each unit\\
        \hline
            $W_i$& $\in\{0,1\}$ & binary treatment for each unit\\
        \hline
            $Y_i$& scalar & primary outcome\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
The primary outcome $Y_i$ is unobservable for individuals in $N_E$ (i.e., in experimental sample, $P_i=E$).
