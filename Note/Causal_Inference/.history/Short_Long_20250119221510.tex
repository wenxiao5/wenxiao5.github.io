\chapter{Predicting Long-term Outcomes}
\section{Surrogate Index: \cite{athey2019surrogate}}
Define two samples $N_E$ (Experimental) and $N_O$ (Observational), $N=N_E+N_O$, where we use $P_i\in\{O,E\}$ as a binary indicator of whether $i$-th observation is in $N_E$ or $N_O$.

For each unit, there is a binary treatment of interests, $W_i\in\{0,1\}$. Given $W_i$, a scalar primary outcome is unobservable, denoted by $Y_i$.
