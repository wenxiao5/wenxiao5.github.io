            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Ranking algorithms are critical platform design mechanisms that determine seller visibility. However, existing research on platform design overlooks two key aspects: sellers' strategic signaling responses, especially the role of prices as quality signals, and how certification programs create seller heterogeneity. To address these gaps, we develop a theoretical framework examining how ranking design—specifically quality-based versus price-based—interacts with both strategic signaling and certification heterogeneity to shape market outcomes. Our analysis reveals two mechanisms. First, quality-based ranking creates a crowding-out effect: while revealing platform-held information, it inadvertently induces low-quality uncertified sellers to mimic high-quality uncertified sellers' pricing, creating pooling equilibria where prices lose informational value. Price-based ranking reverses this dynamic as low-quality uncertified sellers with cost advantages undercut competitors, generating separating equilibria where prices become informative. Second, compared to quality-based ranking, price-based ranking elevates these low-quality uncertified sellers to top positions, widening the perceived quality gap between certified and top-ranked uncertified sellers, and thus reducing competition between them. This creates endogenous market segmentation: certified sellers capture quality-sensitive consumers through premium pricing, while uncertified sellers expand market access to price-sensitive segments through competitive pricing. Empirical analysis of eBay's 2011 ranking algorithm redesign validates these predictions: after the redesign from quality-based to price-based ranking, prices of uncertified sellers declined due to intensified price competition, while prices of certified sellers slightly increased; consumers relied more on certifications and prices as quality signals; and high-quality uncertified sellers experienced significant welfare losses, while low-quality uncertified sellers and certified sellers potentially benefited.
