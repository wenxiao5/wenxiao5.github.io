</a> <br />
Solo Working Paper Supervised by <i>Song Lin</i> and <i>Frank Liu</i> <br />
Presented at <i>ISMS Marketing Science Conference 2022</i><br />
<b>Abstract:</b> We study how an online platform should design a privacy-preserving information environment for advertising auctions. Due to privacy protection, with imprecise data, advertisers need to acquire information prior to bidding for an ad slot. At the same time, the platform needs to pool multiple advertisers together through keywords. By designing the keywords for an advertising slot, the platform can release common information, building on which advertisers can decide how to obtain additional information at a cost. We illustrate that the information acquisition of an advertiser can lead to divergent beliefs, which may lower the bidding cost of the other advertiser. Thus, asymmetric equilibrium may arise where one advertiser engages in information acquisition whereas the other does not. We show that both advertisers will participate in an auction only when the ad slot has an intermediate matching probability. In an optimal information design, the platform maximizes the advertisers' belief about the ad slot while motivating them to bid for it. Furthermore, the platform has the incentive to raise advertisers' cost of information acquisition when the ad slot’s prior matching probability is low and to reduce it when the prior matching probability is high. We discuss the implications for privacy-preserving ad auction design and first-party data collection.

<li><p><a>Predicting Long-run Coupons Effects with Customer Learning
</a> <br />
Deep Learning course project<br />
<b>Abstract:</b> According to the literature on marketing and economics, coupons, in addition to promoting sales in the short run, can also affect the future consumption of customers. It is, therefore, essential to consider more than the one-stage effect of coupons when considering firms' optimal promotion strategies. Unlike Gabel and Timoshenko’s model (2022) which predicts purchase probabilities with coupons in one stage, I intend to develop a model that predicts the long-run effects of coupons in my deep-learning project. Unfortunately, there is a problem in that coupons may have relatively weak long-run effects, and the traditional deep-learning model may find it challenging to learn them directly. To help my deep-learning model learn the long-run effects, I introduce the mechanism of customer learning. In this mechanism, coupons can be used to attract some consumers who fit a product but haven’t purchased it due to the lack of information. These customers can be attracted by the low price with coupons of the product and realize the information of the product’s high value for them. The first step in my deep-learning process is to estimate consumers' prior knowledge based on historical data, followed by adding the estimated prior knowledge to the input layer of the model.  This deep-learning model combined with economic structure is more interpretable and can give better instructions to firms’ promotion policies.</p>

<li><p><a>Advertising Coupon
</a> <br />
Supervised by <i>Song Lin</i><br />
<b>Abstract:</b> We build a new promotional model that combines coupons and advertising. Customers can help the company with advertising in exchange for coupons. We compare this program with other types of referral programs and discounts. If the profit from selling the product is low, the program is always profitable compared to other promotional methods. However, if the profit from selling the product is relatively high, in which case the company will use the program when the consumer values the product very low or very high, and it will use discounts when the consumer values it moderately.</p>

<li><p><a>Should Firms Pay for Useless Referrals?
</a> <br />
Algorithmic Game Theory course project<br />
<b>Abstract:</b> Many firms provide referral programs for consumers, which allows consumers to get rewards by referring new customers. Firms pay for successful referrals that lead to new customers. This project discusses another kind of program, and I call it the same return program. The program rewards customers according to the number of friends they refer. In the program, a firm pays for all referrals, no matter whether it generates new customers. The project proves that if the product is hard for consumers to infer others’ valuations towards it, the same return program is better than the referral programs because the same return program could eliminate the game in the referral programs and remains the best equilibrium for firms and consumers.</p>
