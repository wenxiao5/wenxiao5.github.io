  <br /> I utilize microeconomic theory to study research problems in quantitative marketing and behavioral economics.
  I try to avoid constructing meaningless models with ad hoc, fine-tuned, and non-robust assumptions that lead to seemingly counterintuitive conclusions.<br /><br />
  I was fortunate to be mentored by Prof. <a href="https://mark.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/mksonglin">Song Lin</a> before coming to Berkeley. I completed my undergraduate studies in May 2023 at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a> in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, and Computational Science and Engineering. Prior to that, I was also an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/" target="_blank">Zhejiang University</a> in Hangzhou, China.

    We study how an online platform should design a privacy-preserving information environment for advertising auctions. Due to privacy protection, with imprecise data, advertisers need to acquire information prior to bidding for an ad slot. At the same time, the platform needs to pool multiple advertisers together through keywords. By designing the keywords for an advertising slot, the platform can release common information, building on which advertisers can decide how to obtain additional information at a cost.

    <i>Abstract:</i> Royalty payment has been under heated debate in both the traditional art market and the newly emerged non-fungible tokens (NFTs) markets. In this paper, we investigate the role of royalty payments in the trading market with creators and buyers and explore how NFT platforms should design royalty policies to balance the incentives of both sides. We present three key findings. First, royalty payments can harm NFT creators and the overall market efficiency when creators and buyers hold symmetric information about the artwork's future value. Second, when information asymmetry exists with creators possessing more information about the value of the artwork, we demonstrate that royalty payments can enhance market efficiency by retaining high-quality NFT creators while excluding low-quality ones. Third, when the platform allows creators to commit to a royalty rate, creators may differentiate themselves based on their NFTs' quality, with low-quality creators setting higher prices and lower royalty rates, and high-quality creators opting for lower prices and higher royalty rates. Our findings shed light on how royalty payments can influence the welfare of different players in an NFT market, and the insights can also apply to the traditional art market.

Engaging in research discussions with many PhD applicants, I've come to realize that not everyone possesses independent thinking in research. Many resemble coding machines, uncertain about when they could be replaced by automated artificial intelligence. Keep going, researchers in AI!
</div>
★ A better student than me: <a href="https://xuhang.link/" style="font-family: fantasy;">the "strongest" 24 Fall PhD applicant</a> that I know of -- an independent and insightful student researcher with a remarkable blend of empirical economics and behavioral experiments expertise, coupled with a great taste for theory.
