<li><p><a>Privacy-protected Online Advertising: Information Design in Auctions with Flexible Information Acquisition
</a> <br />
<b>Solo working paper</b> supervised by <i>Song Lin</i> and <i>Yunchuan (Frank) Liu</i> <br />
Presented at <i>ISMS Marketing Science Conference 2022</i><br />
<b>Abstract:</b> We study how an online platform should design a privacy-preserving information environment for advertising auctions. Due to privacy protection, with imprecise data, advertisers need to acquire information prior to bidding for an ad slot. At the same time, the platform needs to pool multiple advertisers together through keywords. By designing the keywords for an advertising slot, the platform can release common information, building on which advertisers can decide how to obtain additional information at a cost. We illustrate that the information acquisition of an advertiser can lead to divergent beliefs, which may lower the bidding cost of the other advertiser. Thus, asymmetric equilibrium may arise where one advertiser engages in information acquisition whereas the other does not. We show that both advertisers will participate in an auction only when the ad slot has an intermediate matching probability. In an optimal information design, the platform maximizes the advertisers' belief about the ad slot while motivating them to bid for it. Furthermore, the platform has the incentive to raise advertisers' cost of information acquisition when the ad slot’s prior matching probability is low and to reduce it when the prior matching probability is high. We discuss the implications for privacy-preserving ad auction design and first-party data collection.

<li><p><a>Advertising Coupon
</a> <br />
Supervised by <i>Song Lin</i><br />
<b>Abstract:</b> We build a new promotional model that combines coupons and advertising. Customers can help the company with advertising in exchange for coupons. We compare this program with other types of referral programs and discounts. If the profit from selling the product is low, the program is always profitable compared to other promotional methods. However, if the profit from selling the product is relatively high, in which case the company will use the program when the consumer values the product very low or very high, and it will use discounts when the consumer values it moderately.</p>

<li><p><a>Should Firms Pay for Useless Referrals?
</a> <br />
Algorithmic Game Theory course project<br />
<b>Abstract:</b> Many firms provide referral programs for consumers, which allows consumers to get rewards by referring new customers. Firms pay for successful referrals that lead to new customers. This project discusses another kind of program, and I call it the same return program. The program rewards customers according to the number of friends they refer. In the program, a firm pays for all referrals, no matter whether it generates new customers. The project proves that if the product is hard for consumers to infer others’ valuations towards it, the same return program is better than the referral programs because the same return program could eliminate the game in the referral programs and remains the best equilibrium for firms and consumers.</p>
